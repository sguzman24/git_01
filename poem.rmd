## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,  
   Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well. 
Rest on the friendly knee, intent to ask. 
         The tale one loves to tell.  

Rude scoffer of the seething outer strife,  
   Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,  
Deem, if thou wilt, such hours a waste of life,  
         Empty of all delight!

In the realm of roads, where engines roar,  
A challenger emerges, strong to the core.  
With sleek design and power untamed,  
The Dodge Challenger, a beast unchained.  

Its body, a canvas, painted with might,  
Muscle and curves, a breathtaking sight.  
Roaring engines, a symphony of speed,  
Challengers rev, fulfilling the need.  

On asphalt battlegrounds, they take their stance,  
Ready to conquer, to seize every chance.  
Adrenaline pulses through veins and veins,  
Challengers ignite, leaving trails of flames.  

Through winding turns and straightaways long,  
Challengers surge, relentless and strong.  
Their presence demands attention and awe,  
As they soar past, leaving onlookers in awe.  

From zero to sixty in a heartbeat's beat,  
Challengers thrive, their power complete.  
Each rev of the engine, a thunderous call,  
Propelling challengers, conquering all.  

In their driver's hands, a thrilling command,  
Merging with metal, a symbiotic stand.  
Challengers embrace the asphalt's allure,  
Unleashing speed, they dare to endure.  

With every gear shift, a challenger's quest,  
To push limits further, to outpace the rest.  
The road becomes their stage, their domain,  
Challengers reign, a driving reign.  

So let us honor these beasts of the road,  
The Dodge Challengers, in power bestowed.  
May their engines roar and spirits arise,  
As challengers conquer, under open skies.
