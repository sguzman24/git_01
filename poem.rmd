## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,  
   Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well. 
Rest on the friendly knee, intent to ask. 
         The tale one loves to tell.  

Rude scoffer of the seething outer strife,  
   Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,  
Deem, if thou wilt, such hours a waste of life,  
         Empty of all delight!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
